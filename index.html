                                Why can't you see that life is not all bad?
                                You're my angel.
                                Please don't cry,
                                I don't understand, so please tell me why?
                                Your beautiful face,
                                Your fading smile,
                                I vow to make you happy for more than just a while.
                                You're so precious,
                                Why can't you see?
                                I beg you to break that chain,
                                Then you'll be free.

                            I want to be able to hold you when you're upset

                            Because I would try my best to make it okay,
                            To make it better for you.
                            And I know you would do the same for me.
                            
                            I want to see you when I wake up, a smile would flood my face.
                            I want to talk to you deeply
                            About things we don't have answers to.
                            I want to get to know you every single day,
                            Because I understand that people change.
                            You will change, but so will I.
                            
                            I not only want to share my mind with you but my body too.
                            I want to kiss you like it's the first time, every time.
                            And I want to feel my love for you flowing through my veins like blood,
                            Warming me up and making my heart beat faster
                            Every time I see your beautiful face.
                            
                            You stole my heart years ago, and you can keep it,
